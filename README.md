# FCDFusion
A fast and color-reserved fusion method for visible and infrared image pairs, and a metric called color deviation.
This is the Python implementation of the paper "FCDFusion: A fast fusion method for visible and infrared image pairs with little color deviation".
When the paper is available in Computational Visual Media 2023, a link will be provided here.
